# Basics of Network Protocol Connections Using Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains examples of basic network protocol connections using Cisco Packet Tracer. These examples are designed to help understand fundamental networking concepts and protocols through practical simulation.

## Overview

Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool that allows users to create network topologies, configure devices, and simulate network protocols. This repository provides a collection of basic network setups demonstrating the use of different protocols.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Ensure you have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system. You can download it from the [Cisco Networking Academy website](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).

### Using the Examples

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jubayer98/Some-Basics-Network-Protocol-Connection-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer.git
   cd Some-Basics-Network-Protocol-Connection-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
   ```

2. **Open in Cisco Packet Tracer**:
   - Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Open the desired `.pkt` file from the cloned repository.

3. **Simulate and Learn**:
   - Use the simulation mode in Cisco Packet Tracer to observe the network behavior.
   - Modify configurations to see how changes affect network performance and connectivity.
